# zed-r
Extension for Zed to support R

# Installing - Zed

The extension interface can be accessed through the command palette (`cmd-shift-p > zed: extensions`) and searching `R`. 
Due to the extension title only being one letter, you may have to scroll a bit to find it!

# Installing - local

To install manually please [zeds documentation](https://github.com/zed-industries/extensions/blob/main/AUTHORING_EXTENSIONS.md#testing-your-extension-locally) on how to install and generate the required tree-sitter grammar.
